Benefits (Pros) for Your Project

<!-- - React Hook Form + Zod
  Eliminates manual state management for form inputs
  Provides built-in validation with type safety
  Reduces re-renders and improves performance -->

<!-- - Context Selector
Prevents unnecessary re-renders when only specific context values change
Better performance optimization for your search provider -->

<!-- - Selectors
Centralizes data transformation logic (like your languageOptions computation)
Easier testing and reusability of derived state -->

<!-- - Schemas
Type-safe API responses and form validation
Runtime validation of GitHub API data
Better error handling for malformed data -->

<!-- - Mappers
  Clean separation between API responses and UI data structures
  Easier to adapt to API changes without affecting components -->

<!--
- API with HttpRequest + Boilerplate
  Standardized error handling and retry logic
  Consistent request/response interceptors
  Better logging and debugging capabilities -->

- FIX ESLINT FUNCTIONS WHEN HAVE USECALLBACK

- Folder Structure
  Clearer separation of concerns and easier navigation
  Better scalability as project grows

- virtualized

## Simple Implementation Steps

- React Hook Form + Zod: Replace useState for form inputs with - useForm hook and create Zod schemas for validation
- Context Selector: Install use-context-selector and refactor your provider to use it
- Selectors: Extract computed values like languageOptions into separate selector functions
- Schemas: Create Zod schemas for GitHub API responses and form data
- Mappers: Create functions to transform API responses to your UI models
- API Boilerplate: Create an HTTP client class with interceptors and error handling
- Folder Structure: Reorganize into feature-based folders with layers (ui, domain, infrastructure)
- Use Cases: Extract search logic into use case classes/functions
- Events Layer: Implement an event emitter system for cross-feature communication
